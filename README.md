# MLB-HoF-Offensive-Analysis

An examination of baseball statistics in relationship to the Major League Baseball (MLB) Hall of fame. The analysis will involve multiple tables in [Sean Lahman's Baseball Database](http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/). Specifically, I am interested in differences around offensive statistics for those in the HoF compared to those not in the HoF.
